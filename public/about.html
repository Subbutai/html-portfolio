  I was born in 2000 in the central district of Kütahya. I attended primary
  school in Cumhuriyet primary school in Banaz district of Uşak province due to
  my father's work and appointment to another branch of the assignment. I
  completed my secondary school in Atakent middle school in the central district
  of Kütahya. With an average score, I enrolled in Kütahya Akşemsettin Anatolian
  Imam Hatip High School. My interest in history and international relations
  started here, but it was short-lived. Afterwards, I ranked 2200th in Turkey in
  the verbal part of the university exam among two million students and chose
  Ibn Haldun University Media and Communication Department. Halfway through my
  education, I started to double major with the psychology department. I am
  currently focusing on web 3.0 technologies.
